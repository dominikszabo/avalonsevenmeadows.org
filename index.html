  <h2></h2>Welcome to Avalon at Seven Meadows</body>h2>
<p>This premier gated community in Fort Bend Country consists of 299 homes on private streets, 28 acres of lakes and fountains, and a park with playground and a junior-size soccer field.  All but 12 of the homes front either the park, a lake, or the adjacent Meadowbrook Farms Golf Club.  The lakes offer opportunities for boating and fishing.  The neighborhood schools, part of Katy ISD, offer outstanding instructional programs with facilities, equipment, and materials that are among the best in the state.
Avalon is also part of the larger Seven Meadows community. As such, Avalon residents enjoy access to the Seven Meadows events and amenities including: a six-acre Central Park and picnic pavilion; a clubhouse with a 24-hour fitness room, theater, meeting room, and a large event room with kitchen that residents may reserve for social events; two swimming pools; numerous play areas, parks, and landscape trails; tennis courts; and daily constable patrols.
